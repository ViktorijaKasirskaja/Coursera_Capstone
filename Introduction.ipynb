Naturally, every tourist will come to a question: \u201cWhich city has more to offer? How are the different?\u201d. \n\nIn this project I will explore city centers of both Barcelona and Madrid to help answer this question and help tourist to make their decision. The result should provide a better understanding of city center life and compare two rival cities. \n\nPlease note, this project ignores some obvious facts, like Barcelona has a beach and Madrid doesn\u2019t, Madrid is cheaper option than Barcelona, Barcelona is much more crowded place than Madrid, Barcelona has Gaudi architecture and Madrid has Prado museum and so on. \n\n**Problem:** Choosing which city to visit.\n**Audience:** Tourists"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### 2.
